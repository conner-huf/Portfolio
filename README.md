# Portfolio

Hi there! This is the source code for my first portfolio. I'm deploying through Github pages. I'm currently working on completing a portfolio using React, but wanted to get v1 out and runnning before investing too much time into it. 

## Update:
I've finally got this to a point where I'm pretty happy with it, and it's deployed. My resume can be downloaded through the link on the portfolio, and contact sends me an update to my google sheet. If you have any critiques or things you feel inclined to tell me I should improve, I invite you to let me know! :)
